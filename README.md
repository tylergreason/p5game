# p5game
A playground for getting back into P5JS

## The What 

This is a small project I made in the week following my time at Flatiron School. The Flatiron program was nothing if not intense, and I wanted to continue programming, but program something that was more.. _casual_. 

p5game is just what it says on the box: a playground for getting back into P5JS. I wanted to make a top down shooter game (like one of my all-time favorites, [Nuclear Throne](http://nuclearthrone.com/)) and the library I knew best was P5JS. There might be better libraries for games out there, but P5JS let me get up and off the ground quickly. 

## The Why 

I made this game as a way to relax! It's pretty frantic, and not relaxing at all to play, _but_: during my time at Flatiron I could not stop thinking about how to apply what I was learning to game development, but I was too busy learning to do so! I came out of the program with all these ideas in my head and _had_ to get them out! p5game was a way to express the ideas I had.
